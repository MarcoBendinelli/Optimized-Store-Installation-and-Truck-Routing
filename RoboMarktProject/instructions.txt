0. Pre-Requisite: having installed AMPL and CPLEX both in the same folder situated in ampl_folder_path
 
1. Install the only needed external library (which is amplpy, an AMPL API for Python) by typing on a terminal in the current folder:

		python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the code main.py by typing on a terminal in the current folder:

		python main.py ampl_folder_path input_data

   where ampl_folder_path is the full path of the folder defined in point 0.  
   and where input_data is the full path to the input .dat file.

NB: The desired output of the problem starts the line after the separator "-----", because the first output lines are generated by amplpy.
