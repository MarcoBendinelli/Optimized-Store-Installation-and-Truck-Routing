# RoboMarkt
Implementation of a program that solves the problem of deciding where to install stores minimizing the building costs (known as [*Generalized Assignment Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_assignment_problem), linear programming problem solved with AMPL) and the problem of deciding the routes of the trucks that periodically refurbish the stores minimizing the driving costs (known as the [*Vehicle Routing Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem), solved with an heuristic method to obtain polynomial execution time).

The full **description of the problem** is available [here](/minimart-2.pdf). 

A detailed **explanatin of the solution** of the problem is available [here](/deliverables/report.pdf). 
Also, an interactive python **notebook** is also available [here](/RoboMarkt.ipynb), which shows plots to better understand the intermadiate steps of the solution of the whole problem.
