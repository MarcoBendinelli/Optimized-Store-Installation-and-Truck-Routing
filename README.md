# StoreNet :convenience_store: :truck:
StoreNet is a program that addresses two key challenges in retail logistics: the [*Generalized Assignment Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_assignment_problem) (GAP), which determines optimal store locations to minimize building costs, and the [*Vehicle Routing Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) (VRP), which optimizes truck routes for store restocking to minimize driving costs.

Find the **full problem description** [here](/minimart-2.pdf).

Explore the **solution explanation** [here](/deliverables/report.pdf). In solving the GAP, linear programming techniques using **AMPL** were employed. For the VRP, a heuristic method was utilized to achieve polynomial execution time.

An **interactive Python notebook** is available [here](/RoboMarkt.ipynb), offering detailed insights into the solution process.
